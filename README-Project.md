Would you Rather is an app built to track preferences over different topics defined by people.

The app provides the following features:

- Answered questions.
- Unanswered questions.
- Add polls.
- Add users.
- Leaderboard.
- Logout

Each one of these is self-explanatory. Just play with them!

Just be aware that once you add a user, you will have to logout, to see the user created.

Each feature (except Logout) is hosted at a specific location:

- Answered questions: /home
- Unanswered questions: /home
- Add polls: /add
- Add users: /adduser
- Leaderboard: /leaderboard

If you type at the browser bar, any of the previous locations you'll be redirected to the login page. If you type a location/URL that doesn't match any of the features locations, you'll be receiving a nice 404 page and the option to login to our app.

To install and run the project just go to the root path of the repository and type:

* run npm install
* run npm start

You should be able to see the application running in your default browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
